    "\n",
    "First you must train the dictionary. To do that, follow the following steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dictionary Training\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a parameters file saved as a .yaml file.\n",
    "You can edit these values as you see fit.\n",
    "You will be asked to enter the path to this fill after --training_parameters.\n",
    "```azure\n",
    "# This is the parameters.yaml file\n",
    "N : 300 # The batch size when random sampling your training data.\n",
    "K : 150 # Number of atoms in the dictionary.\n",
    "I : 10 # Number of iterations to run the k-SVD algorithm to train your dictionary. Values are typically between 0 and 20.\n",
    "L : 10 # Number of atoms to use in sparse coding. Inscreased values increase preformance at the cost of run time.\n",
    "Patch_Shape : [8,8] # This size of the patches in pixels. If the image has color, set it equal to [8,8,3].\n",
    "Partial : False # If False, you will get the full image reconstruction algorithm. If True, you will get the Stochastic Partial Image Reconstruction (SPIR) algorithm. This will take about 20% of the time as the full agorithm, be about 90-90% as accurate, but will most likely have dead pixels on the sides.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a image_paths.yaml file which contains the paths to the training images.\n",
    "You will be asked to enter the path to this file after --image_paths\n",
